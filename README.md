# Superstore-Sales-Dashboard
I have created a Dashboard for Superstore Sales in which I have selected the Page and uploaded background image 
After that I have created different types of charts like Stacked Area Chart, Pie Chart, Funnel Chart, Bar Chart, Donut Chart etc to find Different columns relation with each other.
I have also created a Slicer in Region Column so we get different charts according to region.
Another Page I have created Line Chart to create Sum of Sales by Order Date & also made another graph for Sum of Sales by Order Date in which i have used Forecast.
